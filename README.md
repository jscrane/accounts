# Accounts

An [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) script to manage a (very) small Irish company's accounts.

This script manages the following:

- The company Bank Account
- Company purchases
- Directors' expenses
- VAT

## Getting started

[Download](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) and install RStudio desktop.

Copy the ```templates``` directory to a directory named ```data``` on your machine.

Edit ```accounts.Rmd``` and update the definition of the ```docs``` variable for this location.

Open ```accounts.Rmd``` in RStudio, and _knit_ it.
